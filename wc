wc works in the following format "wc -clmw x"

where -clmw have the following effects
    -c represents byte count
    -l represents line count
    -m represents character count
    -w represents word count

if wc is written without any of -clmw then the line count, word count and character count will be displayed for file x
writing a combination of -c, -l, -m or -w will result in only ones written being displyed.
